2.4 GHz 6-Element Dolph–Chebyshev Microstrip Antenna Array
Overview

This repository documents the design and simulation of a 2.4 GHz 6-element Dolph–Chebyshev microstrip antenna array with a target sidelobe level (SLL) of −30 dB.

The project covers the complete engineering workflow, from designing a single microstrip patch antenna to developing a custom unequal Wilkinson feed network and finally integrating both into a complete antenna array.

Project Workflow
Stage 1 — Single Patch Antenna
Design of a 2.4 GHz inset-fed rectangular microstrip patch antenna.
Simulation and impedance matching using ANSYS HFSS.
Validation of S11 and radiation characteristics.

Stage 2 — Feed Network
MATLAB implementation of Dolph–Chebyshev excitation coefficients.
Conversion of excitation coefficients into required power ratios.
Design of equal and unequal Wilkinson power dividers.
EM and circuit co-simulation using Keysight ADS Momentum.

Stage 3 — Antenna Array (In Progress)
Integration of the feed network with six patch antennas.
Array optimization.
Radiation pattern analysis.
Gain, beamwidth, and sidelobe level evaluation.
